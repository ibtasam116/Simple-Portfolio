            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry 
            out sequences of arithmetic or logicaloperations automatically via computer programming. Modern 
            computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs 
            enable computers to perform anextremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the 
            hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" 
            operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers 
            that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A laptop (also laptop computer), is a small, portable personal 
            computer (PC) with a "clamshell" form factor, typically having a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted 
            on the inside of the upper lid of the clamshell and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the lower 
            lid. The clamshell is opened up to use the computer. Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus 
            are suitable for mobile use.[1] Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed to be placed on a person's lap 
            when being used. Although originally there was a distinction between laptops and notebooks (the former 
            being bigger and heavier than the latter), as of 2014, there is often no longer any difference. Today, 
            laptops are commonly used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games, web 
            browsing, for personal multimedia, and general home computer use.
